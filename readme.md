# Quality Of Life Scripts at Evolany

### These are scripts for easily opening up the environments. 
### You will need iTerm for these to run by default. Feel free to fork and modify the scripts as you see fit.

1. Clone the repo
2. `YOUR_PATH/ruby set_shortcuts.rb`
3. If there is a mistake or you want to change/remove a shortcut, edit your ~/.zshrc file and remove/change as you please.
