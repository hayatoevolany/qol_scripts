# Quality Of Life Scripts at Evolany

### These are scripts for easily opening up the environments. 
### You will need iTerm for these to run by default. Feel free to fork and modify the scripts as you see fit.

### Requirements:
- iTerm
- bot_jump shortcut (i.e. ssh bot_jump should take you to prerelease.)
- anybot pem file

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the set_shortcuts script to set shortcuts: `ruby set_shortcuts.rb`
3. If there is a mistake or you want to change/remove a shortcut, edit your ~/.zshrc file and remove/change as you please.
